matFR: a matlab toolbox for feature ranking

Feature ranking tends to figure out the most informative and discriminative features 
or variables for target representation. It is highly related to feature selection 
and thereby, intelligient diagnosis. 

Several open sources have been released for feature selection, while little attention 
has been paid to feature ranking. At present, we collecte a total of 42 feature ranking 
algorithms into this toolbox (matFR). In addition, we provide a dataset BCDR-F03 and 
records for demo purpose. (BCDR-F03, breast cancer diagnosis repository, please refer to 
"Representation learning for mammography mass lesion classification with convolutional 
neural networks". It contains 406 patient cases and 736 mammographic breast lesion samples).

The toolbox contains 29 supervised and 13 unsupervised algorithms. Among the algorithms, 
there are 12 methods using mutual information and its variants, 8 methods using statistical 
analysis, 8 methods using graph representation and others using different creteria.
